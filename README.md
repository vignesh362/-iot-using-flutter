# iot applications for home automations
 
A new Flutter application.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.
this project which i created was made to control applications around my house with nodemcu/raspberry pi .
this is a simple project with colour changing buttons to distinguish between switching on and off (green- on and grey- off)
and it updates "1" to the firebase when the light is switched on and "0" when it is switched off.
